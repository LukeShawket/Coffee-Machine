# Coffee Machine Simulation    

A Python-based simulation of a coffee machine, capable of making various types of coffee by managing ingredients and handling monetary transactions.

• Coffee Menu: Options for Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino, each with specific ingredients and costs.

• Resource Management: Tracks the remaining resources (water, milk, coffee, money) and updates them after each transaction.

• Interactive User Input: Allows users to turn on the machine, check resources, fill the machine, and turn it off.

• Monetary Transactions: Handles coin insertion and provides change when necessary.
